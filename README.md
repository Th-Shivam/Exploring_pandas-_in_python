# Exploring Pandas in Python 🐍🍷

This repository demonstrates the power of **Pandas** in Python for data manipulation and analysis using the **Red Wine Quality** dataset. Alongside this, popular machine learning models such as Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Logistic Regression are applied to gain insights and predictions.

## 📖 Overview

The **Red Wine Quality** dataset contains physicochemical properties of wine samples, and the goal is to analyze the data and predict wine quality using various machine learning techniques.

Key models demonstrated:
1. **Linear Regression**: Predicting continuous wine quality scores.
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Classifying wine samples based on quality categories.
3. **Logistic Regression**: Solving binary classification problems for wine quality.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used is the **Red Wine Quality** dataset, available [here]([https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality)). It contains the following features:

- **Input Variables**: Physiochemical properties such as pH, alcohol content, residual sugar, etc.
- **Output Variable**: Wine quality score (rated between 0–10).


## 🔧 Features

- Comprehensive use of **Pandas** for:
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing.
  - Feature engineering and selection.
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Hands-on machine learning implementation using Scikit-learn.
- Data visualization with **Matplotlib** for better insights.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `datasets/`: Contains the **red_wine_quality.csv** file.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for step-by-step demonstrations.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for automated execution of tasks.
- `README.md`: This document.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed, then install the required libraries:


pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
